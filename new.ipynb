    "### CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the anonymized nature and the small sample size of our dataset, combined with numerous variables at play, we've made certain assumptions to ensure its suitable for our use-case. Hereâ€™s our approach to understanding player fatigue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Picking Player Data:**\n",
    "   Due to lack of player identification data, we had to infer that first 21 rows represent individual player data. This is based on the understanding that a hockey team typically consists of 20 players. This selection ensures we capture data for each unique player.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying Player Roles:**\n",
    "   We assess the 'Position' column to differentiate between a forward (FW), defenseman (D) and Goalkeeper. The roles they play on the ice rink might result in different fatigue levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Segmentation:**\n",
    "   With hundreds of variables present, we narrow down and segment data by recommended metrics from the icehockey club. This targeted analysis aids in the precise estimation of the Fatigue Index (FI).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Developing the Fatigue Formula:**\n",
    "   Using a combination of the dataset metrics, we create a formula that captures the aspects of player fatigue. This formula is designed to be sensitive to player roles, game dynamics, and other key factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fatigue Estimation:**\n",
    "   Using the curated data from the previous steps, we derive the Fatigue Index (FI).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   We design a clear and easy-to-understand graphic to show the fatigue levels. This helps coaches quickly see and understand player tiredness.\n"
